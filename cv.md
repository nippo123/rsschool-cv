after graduating from university, I learned 1c programming. Now I want to change the programming language because I want to keep abreast of new developments and trends, I want my work to be more explicit and more appreciated.
I am willing to take on new projects and see things through to the end. I work well in a team, I can resolve conflicts and compromise.
hobbies - walking, camping, fishing.
I like to play online games.
